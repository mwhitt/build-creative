      <span class="about-name">Elliot Moore</span>
      <span class="about-title">Co-Founder / Business Development</span>
      <p>Elliot is the creative liaison between some of the largest conglomerates in Silicon Valley and the Creative Expertise of the Build Creative. When he isn&rsquo;t drinking IPA&rsquo;s with prospects, he is directing and producing projects for The Build. Otherwise he&rsquo;s exploring and crafting his own narrative stories.</p>

      <span class="about-name">Sharif Nakhleh</span>
      <span class="about-title">Co-Founder / Creative Director</span>
      <p>Sharif creates concepts, directs, and edits videos at The Build. He&rsquo;s been at it for over 15 years and is versed in the entire process of content creation from concept to web. When he&rsquo;s not distilling a feeling or idea down to its root, he&rsquo;s usually thinking of new ways to tell a story... preferably ones that feature cats, so that he may gain their respect. In the end it&rsquo;s about respect.</p>
